# Machine Learning Basics

## Day 3
### Polynomial Regression
- Polynomial Regression with smartwatch data to predict **hours of sleep** from *pulse, duration, Calorie burned, hours of work*.

### Scaling of features
- Scaling inputs helps to avoid the situation, when one or several *features dominate others in magnitude*, as a result, the model hardly picks up the *contribution* of the *smaller scale variables*, even if they are strong.

### Test / Train Split
- Separating data into training and testing sets is an important part of evaluating data mining models.
- Split data randomly to ensure that the testing and training sets are similar.
- By using similar data for training and testing, you can minimize the effects of data discrepancies and better understand the characteristics of the model.

### R2 Score
- R-squared is the fraction by which the variance of the errors is less than the variance of the dependent variable.  (The latter number would be the error variance for a constant-only model, which merely predicts that every observation will equal the sample mean.)

### DecissionTreeClassifier
- Classification of shows data and visualization of decission tree.
